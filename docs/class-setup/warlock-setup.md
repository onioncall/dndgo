# Warlock Setup

### `sub-class`
**Description:**
Otherworldly Patron is the subclass for Warlock. It can be any string and is not case sensitive

### `invocation`
**Description:**
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. You gain additional invocations at higher levels (5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th). When you gain certain warlock levels, you can choose to replace one invocation you know with a different one. *Currently, invocation logic is not implemented*

**Allowed Values:** List of eldritch invocation names
- See the Player's Handbook, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and Tasha's Cauldron of Everything for the full list of invocations
- Some invocations have prerequisites (minimum level, specific pact boon, or patron)
- You can have a maximum of 8 invocations at level 20


**Examples**: *not a comprehensive list*
- "Agonizing Blast"
- "Devil's Sight"
- "Armor of Shadows"
